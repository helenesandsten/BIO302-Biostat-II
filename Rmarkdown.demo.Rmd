## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

All this is pre-set stuff from the markdown file: 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Hello!
### this is my Rmarkdown document 

Take a lot at this **simple boxplot**, that *Richard* taught ***me*** how to make:

Here I imported the libraries i need:
```{r, message = FALSE}
# loading libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Here I createed an object (or dataframe?) from the excel sheet with the data:
```{r, warning = FALSE}
#### NEW AND IMPROVED MT GONGA STUFF ####
# Importing data and making dataframe 'mtgonga'
mtgonga <- "biomass2015.xls" 
```

Here I made an object I'm not sure how to describe: (should be space after this)
```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Making object with data from all sheets of 'mtgonga' 
mtg_data <- excel_sheets(mtgonga) %>% 
  map_dfr(~ read_excel(mtgonga, sheet = .x))
```

Here is the code for the **simple boxplot** 
```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Simple boxplot 
ggplot(mtg_data, aes(x = site, y = production)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

All this is pre-set stuff from the markdown file: 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
